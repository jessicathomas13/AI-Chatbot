[["what are the basics of quantum physics?", "Quantum physics, also known as quantum mechanics, is a branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales, such as atoms and subatomic particles. Here are some of the basics of quantum physics:\n\n1. Quantization: Quantum physics introduces the idea that certain physical quantities, such as energy and angular momentum, can only exist in discrete, quantized values. This is in contrast to classical physics, where these quantities can take any value.\n\n2. Wave-particle duality: Quantum physics reveals that particles, such as electrons and photons, can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. They can behave as waves, spreading out and interfering with each other, or as particles, localized entities with specific positions.\n\n3. Superposition: Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously, thanks to a principle called superposition. For example, an electron can be in a superposition of being in two different places at the same time. This concept is fundamental to quantum computing.\n\n4. Uncertainty principle: The uncertainty principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg, states that there is a fundamental limit to how precisely certain pairs of physical properties, such as position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. The more accurately you measure one property, the less accurately you can know the other.\n\n5. Quantum entanglement: Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the others. Even when separated by large distances, changes to one particle will instantaneously affect the other, defying classical notions of locality.\n\n6. Quantum states and measurements: Quantum systems are described by mathematical entities called wavefunctions, which contain information about the probabilities of different outcomes when measurements are made. When a measurement is performed, the wavefunction \"collapses\" into one of the possible outcomes.\n\nThese are just a few of the fundamental concepts in quantum physics, and the field is known for its counterintuitive and sometimes perplexing nature. It continues to be an active area of research and has revolutionized our understanding of the microscopic world."]]
