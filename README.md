# AI-ChatBot
ChatBot using ChatGPT API and Gradio

## How to run the program

- Sign up for OpenAI and get an API Key and add this key to the .env file. (I have included my own API Key for example in the file provided)
- Run the python program (make sure all the imports are installed) and click the link that pops up in the Run terminal in either the local URL or the public URL form.
- It should look like this:
